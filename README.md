# Important 
Snowtrace.io now has a paid API, even for the testnet. I tried to bypass this, but I found out through the Metacrafters Discord that you can no longer use this API workaround. They mentioned that the course will be updated later. For now, you can directly deploy your contracts without relying on the API.
# Degen Token  

This is an ERC20 token built using OpenZeppelin contract wizard and Deployed on Fuji C Chain AVAX.

## Description

This contract is a simple contract which provides the user with multiple options such as transfering tokens to other users and redeeming their tokens for items in the DEGEN Shop and burning tokens!

It also allows the owner to mint tokens, check other user's balances.

It is built using hardhat and solidity and deployed to Fuji C Chain testnet and it can be checked using snowtrace by providing the address to which it is deployed too.

### Running the program

You can duplicate the DGNToken.sol file, compile it in remix online ide, and deploy the token by pasting the address that it was deployed to previously. Then you can use your metamask wallet with testnet avax as gas fee for your account.
